## Important Guidelines

### Weight Selection
- **Start light** - You should be able to complete all reps with good form
- **Focus on form** over weight amount
- **Increase gradually** - Add weight only when you can easily complete all sets

### Progression Tips
- **Week 1-2**: Focus on learning exercises and building routine
- **Week 3-4**: Increase cardio duration by 2-3 minutes if comfortable
- **Week 5+**: Gradually increase weights while maintaining high reps

**Rest Days**: Light walking, stretching, or complete rest - listen to your body!
